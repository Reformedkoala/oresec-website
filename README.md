# OreSec Website

### The OreSec website was in need of renewal/refurbishing. This was created without mozzarella and instead uses templated HTML with CSS for styling and a Go backend for an easy and secure http/https serving format.

## How to develop locally:
### Clone the repo
### install Go and the neccesary packages (formalize this process soonTM)
### Run $go build oresec-site
### Run $go run oresec-site


## TODO
### HTTPS is neccesary at Mines and needs to be implemented/proper redirects
### Need to add some other information pages as well as add to the calendar
### Maybe change around some of the styling/add splash images from competitions/meetings
